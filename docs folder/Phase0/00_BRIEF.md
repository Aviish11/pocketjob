# PocketJob — Product Brief

## Problem
Job seekers waste time jumping between LinkedIn, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, and email inboxes to track applications. They lose track of statuses, follow-ups, and where they applied.

## Solution
PocketJob centralizes everything:
- Chrome extension scrapes job listing info from major job sites and pushes it into the app.
- Email integration automatically links employer communication to the right application.
- Dashboard shows progress, deadlines, and outcomes.

## Target Users
- Young job seekers (students, graduates, early professionals).
- Tech-savvy, mobile-first, short attention span, prefer vibrant and aesthetic apps.

## Version 1 Goals
1. Vibrant, aesthetic UI to appeal to younger audience.
2. Show all tracked applications and automatically update status when emails arrive:
   - In progress
   - Rejected (when rejection email received)
   - No response (after 20 days without response)
3. Chrome extension scrapes job info during application on Indeed/LinkedIn/ZipRecruiter.
4. Application details page shows:
   - Job posting site
   - Listing info (title, company, salary, description)
   - All related emails
5. Dashboard home page shows:
   - Jobs applied this week
   - “Top” job applied (highest salary/role)
   - Section for captured emails

## Nice-to-Have (later)
